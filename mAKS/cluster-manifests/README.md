# Cluster Baseline Configuration Files (GitOps)

> Note: This is part of the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Baseline Cluster for Regulated Workloads reference implementation. For more information check out the [readme file in the root](/README.md).

This is the root of the GitOps configuration directory. These Kubernetes object files are expected to be deployed via your in-cluster Flux operator. They are our AKS cluster's baseline configuration. Generally speaking, they are workload agnostic and tend to be all cluster-wide configuration concerns.

## Contents

* Flux v2 (self-managing) (see: [`flux-system`](./flux-system/))
* "Deny All" policies for the `default` namespace (see: [`default`](./default/))
* Sample Falco install (see: [`falco-system`](./falco-system/))
* Cluster-wide RBAC assignments (see: [`cluster-rbac.yaml`](./cluster-rbac.yaml))
* Azure Monitor Agent Configuration (see [`kube-system`](./kube-system/))
* [Kured](#kured) (see: [`cluster-baseline-settings`](./cluster-baseline-settings/kured/))

* Placeholder [FIM](./cluster-baseline-settings/fim/) and [AV](./cluster-baseline-settings/av/) solution.
* Cluster workload utility, NGINX as an ingress controller (see: [`ingress-nginx`](./ingress-nginx))
* Open Service Mesh configuration (see: [`osm-config.yaml`](./kube-system/osm-config.yaml))

### Kured

Kured is included as a solution to handle occasional required reboots from daily OS patching. This open-source software component is only needed if you require a managed rebooting solution between weekly [node image upgrades](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/aks/node-image-upgrade). Building a process around deploying node image upgrades [every week](https://github.com/Azure/AKS/releases) satisfies most organizational weekly patching cadence requirements. Combined with most security patches on Linux not requiring reboots often, this leaves your cluster in a well supported state. If weekly node image upgrades satisfies your business requirements, then remove Kured from this solution by removing [`- kured.yaml` from `kustomization.yaml`](./cluster-baseline-settings/kustomization.yaml). If however weekly patching using node image upgrades is not sufficient and you need to respond to daily security updates that mandate a reboot ASAP, then using a solution like Kured will help you achieve that objective. **Kured is not supported by Microsoft Support.**
